## Activities & Events

### 11.09.2020: Tutorial at IEEE Euro S&P
We have conducted online the [IEEE Security & Privacy tutorial on Microcontroller-based IoT Security](https://future-proof-iot.github.io/Tutorial/) based on the RIOT-fp prototype software platform, and leveraging our open access testbed FIT IoT-lab for remote participants.

### 24.07.2020: New RIOT Release 2020.07 featuring OpenWSN network stack support
The latest RIOT release (code named 2020.07) is released.  New network protocols were ported for RIOT such as MQTT and the lookup clientcomponent for CoRE RD. The OpenWSN network stack with 6TiSCH support is now also supported in RIOT. 546 pull requests, composed of 10452 commits, have been merged since the
last release 3 months ago, and 84 issues have been solved. 64 people contributed with code in 106 days!

### 27.04.2020: Information Flow Control with LIO* 
In the context of WP3 on composite formal verification, we have published a new [report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12885.pdf) on low-level information flow control with F*.

### 04.06.2020: MooC on IoT and Security based on RIOT
We have co-authored and released a new [massive online course on low-power IoT](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:inria+41020+session01/about), featuring a large part with hands-on activities using RIOT. Of course, there was a module on IoT security featuring SUIT-compliant IoT software udates! There were 6,757 participants from 110 countries for this first session this semester. Next session in Feb. 2021. Be there!

### 09.03.2020: New IETF draft standard specification for secure IoT software updates
We have published a new version of the IETF draft specification for the [SUIT manifest](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-suit-manifest-04) which secures IoT software updates metadata, end-to-end while in transit from the authorized software OEM to the IoT device, in a low-power manner.

### 28.02.2020: Demo of early RIOT-fp prototype at European Commission (Brussels)
At H2020 SPARTA project review at Brussels European Commission, a [preliminary prototype demo of RIOT-fp](https://future-proof-iot.github.io/RIOT-fp/files/(2020-02)-SPARTA-RIOT-fp-demo.pdf) was presented, demonstrating secure low-power IoT firmware update on an indoor air quality monitor.

### 19.02.2020: Draft Requirements Document for the LAKE protocol
The IETF has issued its last call for our draft [requirements for the LAKE protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lake-reqs-01).

### 06.02.2020: Preliminary design of a zero-touch enrollment protocol
We have published a [preliminary design for a zero-touch enrollment protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-selander-ace-ake-authz-00) based on LAKE.



### 15.11.2019: New RIOT Release with Initial SUIT Support
The latest release ([Release-2019.10](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/releases/tag/2019.10)) of RIOT is now available. This release brings a number of improvements and additional features, including initial support for SUIT-compliant secure IoT firmware updates, over the network. Check out this [example](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/examples/suit_update) which you could reproduce on your favorite low-power hardware!

### 19.09.2019: RIOT-fp Workshop Fall 2019
The first RIOT-fp workshop takes place in Paris on Sept. 19th 2019. Here is the [agenda](workshops/RIOT-fp-Workshop-2019-09-19-kickoff.md).

### 10.09.2019: Applicability of Refinement Type Theory for Embedded IoT Logic
We have published a paper investigating the [applicability of refinement type theory to IoT devices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8715067). In practice, we consider the simple yet challenging verification of a stepper motor controller. The paper overviews the constraints which challenge thorough verification using F*. This study encompasses not only software artefacts such as the OS running on the device, but also physical artefacts, including a discrete real-time abstraction of its hardware architecture. A version of the paper not behind a paywall is also [available](https://www.irisa.fr/prive/talpin/papers/date19.pdf).

### 27.08.2019: IETF steps towards authenticated key exchange for OSCORE

A new working group called [LAKE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lake/about/) (Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange) is being chartered in the IETF aiming to design a [key exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-selander-lake-reqs) protocol for OSCORE. OSCORE is an application-layer protection mechanism for CoAP used in 6TiSCH networks. The LAKE outcome is important for RIOT-fp as one of our objectives is to design a zero-touch secure joining protocol for Internet of Things networks, with dependency on both OSCORE and LAKE.

### 07.06.2019: New publication on secure IoT firmware update

Together with ARM, we published a [new article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725488) in IEEE Access, which describes the guts of our preliminary prototype for secure firmware update on microcontroller-based IoT devices, using RIOT and the upcoming SUIT specification from IETF.

### 02.05.2019: New RIOT release!

RIOT 2019.04 is now [available](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/releases/tag/2019.04), which includes a number of new features including porting of riotboot to a number of new platforms, and the ability for firmware to flash images into a separate boot slot. Basic IEEE 802.15.4 support was added on the nRF52840, as well as support for several new boards and new sensors.

### 26.04.2019: New website

The RIOT-fp [website](https://future-proof-iot.github.io/RIOT-fp) launched!

### 20.03.2019: RIOT-fp project start

The RIOT-fp project launched!
