## Software

In the context of their work within RIOT-fp, project members develop, upstream and maintain a number of open source software code bases, including:

- [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) -- A general-purpose operating system and various software libraries for low-power IoT devices, including an implementation of [SUIT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/suit/about/) secured IoT software updates.

- [EDHOC-rs](https://github.com/openwsn-berkeley/edhoc-rs) -- implementation in Rust and hacpsec of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC)

- [libCOSE](https://github.com/bergzand/libcose) -- A compact implementation of CBOR Object Signing and Encryption ([COSE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152)).

- [Hax](https://github.com/hacspec/hax) --  an open source implementation of a tool for high assurance translations of Rust into formal languages such as F* or Coq. 

- [Wave](https://github.com/wavesign/) -- C Reference implementation of Wave, a signature scheme submitted to the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization (in 2023) project signature on-ramp.

- [RIOT-rs](https://github.com/future-proof-iot/RIOT-rs) -- A Rust (re)implementation of RIOT's kernel core.

- [Wavelet](https://github.com/waveletc/wavelet) The first implementation of WAVE code-based postquantum signatures with fast verification on microcontrollers.

- [CTIDH](https://ctidh.isogeny.org) -- C/X86 Assembly implementation of isogeny-based key exchange with side-channel protections.  **Current speed record holder**.

- [Hacspec](https://github.com/hacspec/hacspec) -- Succinct, executable, verifiable specs for high-assurance Rust software modules.

- [OpenWSN](https://github.com/openwsn-berkeley/openwsn-fw) -- The reference implementation of the [6TiSCH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/6tisch/about/) network stack.

- [HACL*](https://github.com/project-everest/hacl-star) -- A formally verified software library of cryptographic algorithms, including Curve25519, Ed25519, AES-GCM, Chacha20, Poly1305, SHA-2, SHA-3, HMAC, and HKDF.

- [riotboot-rs](https://github.com/future-proof-iot/riotboot-rs) -- An implementation of RIOT's bootloader in Rust and Hacspec. 

- [EDHOC-C](https://github.com/future-proof-iot/EDHOC-C) and [py-edhoc](https://github.com/openwsn-berkeley/py-edhoc) -- implementations of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE ([EDHOC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-lake-edhoc-09)).

- [nanoCBOR](https://github.com/bergzand/NanoCBOR) -- A tiny CBOR library aimed at embedded and heavily constrained devices.

- [femto-containers](https://github.com/future-proof-iot/Femto-Container_tutorials) -- A hosting engine for tiny [rBPF]{https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3528535.3565242} virtual machines on IoT microcontrollers, with a verified interpreter.
